# Vue Instance

- It is possible to have more that one vue instance.
- It is possible to access the properties from the a Vue instance from outside the Vue instance, either from another Vue instance, or from normal Javascript outside the Vue instance.
- Vue JS proxies the properties so that we can access the properties from outside the Vue instance.
